# Sinclair BASIC memory cards

Generates a printable **PDF of memory-game cards** that teach a young child (≈7)
the Sinclair BASIC commands of the rubber-key ZX Spectrum.

Each command becomes a **matching pair**:

- a **word card** — just the BASIC keyword (`PRINT`, `BEEP`, `CIRCLE`, …), big and clear, and
- a **picture card** — an AI-drawn pictogram of what the command does.

The child wins a pair by matching the keyword to the right picture. There is no
other text to read: the cards are plain **square, black-on-white** cards, and the
only colour anywhere is inside the pictures. The pictures are **white-background
vector-graphic art** in one consistent style across the whole deck.

## How the pictures are made (two AI steps per command)

1. **Claude Opus** is asked, one command at a time, to invent a short
   *image-generation prompt* describing a clear pictogram for that command.
2. **OpenAI's image model** turns that prompt into a PNG.

Both results are cached under `cache/` (prompts in `cache/prompts.json`, images in
`cache/images/`), so re-running only does the work that is missing and you never
pay for the same picture twice.

## Groups

Every named keyword printed on the rubber-key keyboard in **white** (keyword mode),
**green** (extended mode) and **red** (symbol shift) is included — the full Sinclair
BASIC command set (the bare comparison glyphs `<=` `>=` `<>` and pure punctuation
are the only things left out, as they aren't named commands). They are split into
three decks so you can start small and add harder cards later:

| Deck | Corner mark | Commands |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Simple** — typed every session, plus colour & sound | 1 dot | `PRINT` `LET` `INPUT` `RUN` `LIST` `CLS` `NEW` `GOTO` `GOSUB` `RETURN` `IF` `THEN` `FOR` `TO` `STEP` `NEXT` `PAUSE` `STOP` `REM` `BORDER` `PAPER` `INK` `FLASH` `BRIGHT` `INVERSE` `OVER` `BEEP` `CLEAR` `CONTINUE` `COPY` `LOAD` `SAVE` |
| **Intermediate** — graphics, data, printer, files, common functions | 2 dots | `PLOT` `DRAW` `CIRCLE` `POKE` `PEEK` `DIM` `DATA` `READ` `RESTORE` `RANDOMIZE` `AT` `TAB` `LINE` `LPRINT` `LLIST` `LEN` `STR$` `VAL` `VAL$` `CHR$` `CODE` `RND` `INKEY$` `AND` `OR` `NOT` `DEF FN` `FN` `MERGE` `VERIFY` `CAT` `FORMAT` `MOVE` `ERASE` `OPEN #` `CLOSE #` `IN` `OUT` |
| **Advanced** — maths & machine functions | 3 dots | `SIN` `COS` `TAN` `ASN` `ACS` `ATN` `LN` `EXP` `INT` `SQR` `SGN` `ABS` `PI` `USR` `BIN` `POINT` `SCREEN$` `ATTR` |

Each deck flows across as many A4 pages as it needs (20 cards to a page, in a 4×5
grid of squares). The only marking of the deck is one, two or three **small faint dots** in the
top-right corner — deliberately unobtrusive, just enough to sort the cards back into
decks after cutting so you can play with the Simple deck on its own first.

> The full deck is 88 commands = 176 cards, so a full run makes 88 Claude calls and
> 88 image calls (all cached, so you only pay once). Generate one deck at a time with
> `--groups simple` if you'd rather spread out the cost.

## Setting up the environment

### Nix flakes (recommended)

The `flake.nix` here provides a pinned Python that already has the dependencies
— no virtualenv, no `pip install`. It reads the package list straight from
`requirements.txt`, so the dependencies are only ever listed in one place.

```bash
cd sinclair-memory-cards
nix develop            # drops you into a shell with the right Python
```

If you use [direnv](https://direnv.net), an `.envrc` is included — run
`direnv allow` once and the shell loads automatically whenever you `cd` in.

### Plain pip (alternative)

```bash
cd sinclair-memory-cards
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generating the cards

Once you're in the environment (Nix shell or venv):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Preview the layout with no AI calls / no cost:
python generate_cards.py --placeholder

# Generate the real cards (all three decks):
python generate_cards.py

# Just the easy deck:
python generate_cards.py --groups simple

# Rebuild the PDF from the cache without calling any AI again:
python generate_cards.py --skip-generation
```

The result is `sinclair-memory-cards.pdf`. Print it at **100% / actual size**
(turn off "fit to page"), then cut along the square card borders. Cards are about
44 × 44 mm squares — a comfortable size for small hands. Printing on thin card or
gluing to cardboard makes the cards last longer and stops the picture showing
through from behind.

## Model overrides (optional)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-5` | Any Claude Opus model id (the latest Opus is a good choice). |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` | `gpt-image-1` | Set to whichever OpenAI image model you have access to. |

## Files

- `generate_cards.py` — the generator (AI calls + PDF layout)
- `commands.py` — the command list and deck definitions (edit to taste)
- `flake.nix` — Nix dev shell; reads its package list from `requirements.txt`
- `.envrc` — optional direnv hook to auto-load the Nix shell
- `requirements.txt` — the one dependency list, used by both pip and the flake
- `cache/` — generated prompts and images (safe to delete to regenerate)
