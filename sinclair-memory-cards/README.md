# Sinclair BASIC memory cards

Generates a printable **PDF of memory-game cards** that teach a young child (≈7)
the Sinclair BASIC commands of the rubber-key ZX Spectrum.

The card set is driven by the programs we actually write: the script scans the
BASIC programs in the repository's [`programs/`](../programs) folder, extracts the
unique Sinclair BASIC keywords used in them, and makes cards **only for those** —
so the learning starts with the commands that really come up, not the whole
keyboard at random. Add a new program and re-run: cards for its newly-used
commands are added (everything already generated is cached).

Each command becomes a **matching pair**:

- a **word card** — just the BASIC keyword (`PRINT`, `BEEP`, `CIRCLE`, …), big and clear, and
- a **picture card** — an AI-drawn pictogram of what the command does.

The child wins a pair by matching the keyword to the right picture. There is no
other text to read: the cards are plain **square, black-on-white** cards, and the
only colour anywhere is inside the pictures. The pictures are **white-background
vector-graphic art** in one consistent style across the whole deck.

## How the pictures are made (two AI steps per command)

1. **GPT 5.6** is asked, one command at a time, to invent a short
   *image-generation prompt* describing a clear pictogram for that command
   (it already knows what each Sinclair BASIC command does).
2. An image model turns that prompt into a PNG — **Ideogram 4 Turbo** by default,
   or **OpenAI Image 2** with `--image-backend openai`.

Both results are cached under `cache/` (prompts in `cache/prompts.json`, images in
`cache/images/<backend>/`), so re-running only does the work that is missing and
you never pay for the same picture twice. Each backend keeps its own image cache,
so you can generate both and compare; the prompts are shared.

## Which commands get cards

By default: **the keywords used in `programs/*.bas`**. The scanner understands
real Spectrum listings — it ignores line numbers, text inside `"strings"` and
`REM` comments, and recognises `GO TO` / `GO SUB` (as the keyboard spells them)
as `GOTO` / `GOSUB`.

Recognition happens against the full catalog in `commands.py` — every named
keyword printed on the rubber-key keyboard in **white** (keyword mode), **green**
(extended mode) and **red** (symbol shift); only the bare comparison glyphs
`<=` `>=` `<>` and pure punctuation are left out, as they aren't named commands.
Pass `--all` to print the entire catalog instead of scanning the programs.

Since the programs themselves decide which commands appear, there is no grouping
into difficulty decks — the set is already exactly the commands worth learning
right now. Cards are printed in the catalog's teaching order, 20 to an A4 page
in a 4×5 grid of squares, across as many pages as needed.

> One GPT 5.6 call + one Ideogram call per command, both cached — so you only ever
> pay for a command's picture once, no matter how many times you re-run.

## Setting up the environment

### Nix flakes (recommended)

The `flake.nix` here provides a pinned Python (currently 3.12 — set via
`pythonAttr` at the top of the flake) that already has the dependencies — no
virtualenv, no `pip install`. It reads the package list straight from
`requirements.txt`, so the dependencies are only ever listed in one place.

```bash
cd sinclair-memory-cards
nix develop            # drops you into a shell with the right Python
```

If you use [direnv](https://direnv.net), an `.envrc` is included — run
`direnv allow` once and the shell loads automatically whenever you `cd` in.

### Plain pip (alternative)

```bash
cd sinclair-memory-cards
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Secrets (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env        # set OPENAI_API_KEY and IDEOGRAM_API_KEY
```

The generator loads `.env` automatically (no `python-dotenv` needed). The real
`.env` is git-ignored — never commit it. If a variable is already exported in
your shell, that value wins over the file.

## Generating the cards

Once you're in the environment (Nix shell or venv) and have your `.env`:

```bash
# Preview the layout with no AI calls / no cost:
python generate_cards.py --placeholder

# Generate cards for the commands used in ../programs (the default):
python generate_cards.py

# Draw the pictures with OpenAI Image 2 instead of Ideogram 4 Turbo:
python generate_cards.py --image-backend openai

# The full keyboard catalog instead of scanning the programs:
python generate_cards.py --all

# Scan a different folder of .bas files:
python generate_cards.py --programs /path/to/programs

# Rebuild the PDF from the cache without calling any AI again:
python generate_cards.py --skip-generation
```

The result is `sinclair-memory-cards.pdf`. Print it at **100% / actual size**
(turn off "fit to page"), then cut along the square card borders. Cards are about
44 × 44 mm squares — a comfortable size for small hands. Printing on thin card or
gluing to cardboard makes the cards last longer and stops the picture showing
through from behind.

## Model overrides (optional)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `IMAGE_BACKEND` | `ideogram` | Default for `--image-backend`: `ideogram` or `openai`. |
| `OPENAI_TEXT_MODEL` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | The OpenAI model used to write each image prompt. |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` | `gpt-image-2` | Used with `--image-backend openai`. |
| `IDEOGRAM_URL` | `https://api.ideogram.ai/v1/ideogram-v4/generate` | Ideogram generate endpoint. |
| `IDEOGRAM_RENDERING_SPEED` | `TURBO` | `TURBO`, `DEFAULT` or `QUALITY`. |
| `IDEOGRAM_ASPECT_RATIO` | `1x1` | Square by default; set empty to let the model choose. |

## Files

- `generate_cards.py` — the generator (program scanning + AI calls + PDF layout)
- `commands.py` — the keyword catalog (edit to taste)
- `flake.nix` — Nix dev shell; reads its package list from `requirements.txt`
- `.env.example` — template for your API keys; copy to `.env` (git-ignored)
- `.envrc` — optional direnv hook to auto-load the Nix shell
- `requirements.txt` — the one dependency list, used by both pip and the flake
- `cache/` — generated prompts and images (safe to delete to regenerate)
